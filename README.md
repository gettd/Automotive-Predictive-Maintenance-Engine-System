# Automotive Predictive Maintenance Engine System

This repository contains the codebase and data pipeline for **transforming tabular engine health data into synthetic time series datasets**, and training/testing a machine learning model to perform predictive maintenance on vehicle engines.

This project is part of the Computer Engineering (EGCI) Bachelor Thesis at **Mahidol University**. The full paper, including background, motivations, methodology, and results, can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/gettd/Thesis-Paper).

## Project Summary

The goal is to simulate realistic sequential vehicle engine data using a publicly available tabular dataset and use that data to **train a time-series model** capable of early fault detection (specifically overheating and lubrication failures).

The public dataset used comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parvmodi/automotive-vehicles-engine-health-dataset/data), and was featured in the published IEEE paper [#10912235](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912235).

Since the original dataset is not time series-based, this project performs:

1. **Transformation of tabular data into sequential time series format**
2. **Simulation of failure cases with early warning signs**
3. **Noise injection to simulate real-world sensor readings**
4. **Model training using LSTM**
5. **Evaluation on synthetic test sequences**

## How to Run the Project

Assuming you have the original dataset`engine_data.csv` ready in `datasets/data`:

### Step 1: Generate Synthetic Time Series
```bash
python generate_synthetic_timeseries.py
```
> Configure the number of generated datasets inside the script (by default, **N** = 40). More data leads to better results but increases training time.

> Allocate the datasets to training and testing directory as you prefer.

### Step 2 (Optional): Visualize the Generated Data
```bash
python plot_timeseries.py
```

### Step 3: Train the Model
```bash
python train_model.py
```
> This will save the trained model (`lstm_model.keras`) and the scaler (`scaler.pkl`).

### Step 4: Test the Model
```bash
python test_model.py
```
> You can configure the script to:
> - Pick **K** random datasets from the synthetic data folder
> - Or test on a specific dataset file

## Dependencies

You'll need Python 3.x and the following packages (can be installed via pip):

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow joblib
```

### Python Built-in Modules Used
- `os`
- `pathlib`
- `random`

## Example Output

Each synthetic dataset contains 10,000 rows of 1Hz sensor data with simulated failure or healthy patterns. Here's a sample of the output schema:

| Time | Engine rpm | Lub oil pressure | Fuel pressure | Coolant temp | ... | Engine Condition |
|------|------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|-----|------------------|
| 0    | 1600       | 4.3              | 2.1            | 90.1          | ... | 0                |
| ...  | ...        | ...              | ...            | ...           | ... | 1 (if failed)    |

Plots and model test results are saved under `datasets/plot/`.
